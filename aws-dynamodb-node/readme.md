# DynamoDB Example Code for NodeJS

[DynamoDB Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/DynamoDB.html)

## Introduction

In this tutorial I'm going to show you how you can use NodeJS to store, query, and update data in an AWS DynamoDB data table.

## What is DynamoDB?

If you're watching this, you likely already know what DynamoDB is but just in case - DynamoDB is a fast and easy to use NoSQL database service from Amazon Web Services. It's fully managed, so there's no software to install or hardware to configure.

## Getting started

To use DynamoDB you'll need to have an Amazon Web Services account. If you don't have one you can signup at aws.amazon.com.

I like DynamoDB for three main reasons: it's easy to use, it's super scalable, and it's affordable. In fact, for most small apps you probablly won't pay anything because Amazon provides a free usage tier that's pretty generous.
